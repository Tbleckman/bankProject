# bankProject
banking system with java that manages a users bank accounts with 15 inputs which alters and presents data of the users account with a user interface (terminal)
Implements/manipulates linked lists as the main data structure
Interface manages different bank objects in the user object 
Uses I/O to save the data into a presentable text file, and upload the text file back into data to start where you last left off
Comments explain all functions / classes
Learned the importance of being able to self-learn concepts
“User-proofed” so that users don’t crash the program
Revolves around a user object that can have anywhere from 0-3 bank objects, with all objects having constraints and unique attributes
